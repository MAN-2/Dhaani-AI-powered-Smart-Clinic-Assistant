## Dhaani: AI Powered Smart Clinical Assistant
Dhaani is an intelligent doctor dashboard and clinical assistant designed to streamline healthcare professionals‚Äô workflow. It integrates appointment management, patient tracking, and AI-powered natural language assistance to empower modern medical practice.

 ## Features
- CRUD operations on **doctors** and **appointments** using RESTful FastAPI endpoints (Swagger UI enabled).
- Use **natural language prompts** (via OpenRouter LLM API) to:
  - Book or reschedule appointments
  - Generate calendar event links
  - Trigger summary report tools
  - Send email confirmations
  - Generate Patient Appointment Summary
  

- Designed for **MCP-style agent tool orchestration**
- Frontend built with React 

Doctor Dashboard:
Manage your patients, appointments, and availability from a clean, intuitive React interface.

## Smart AI Chat Assistant:
Built-in AI agent that understands natural language commands like ‚Äúlist my patients,‚Äù ‚Äúshow today‚Äôs schedule,‚Äù or ‚Äúsend follow-up email,‚Äù and executes corresponding tasks automatically.

Appointment Management:
Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments easily with automated backend support.

Patient Management:
View detailed patient records, summaries, and generate comprehensive reports.

Follow-Up Emails:
Automatically compose and send professional follow-up emails after visits.

Real-Time Interactive UI:
Features include an availability calendar, upcoming appointments list with detailed tooltips, and a 3D brain visualization background for a modern user experience.

## Installation
Clone the repository

Install backend dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install frontend dependencies:
npm install within the frontend folder

Configure environment variables for API keys and database connection

This project implements a natural language assistant to manage doctor appointments and generate patient visit summaries using FastAPI and LLM agent-based orchestration. It follows the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** architecture, where an LLM dynamically selects backend tools based on user intent ‚Äî such as scheduling, conflict resolution, email notifications, and summary generation.
